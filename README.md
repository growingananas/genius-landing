# genius-landing

I have implemented the landing page for Genius company using HTML/SCSS/JS/Git. The goals which I tried to achive:
-pixel-perfect;
-fully-responsive;
-functional burger menu

The design was rather lengthy and since I was running out of time I haven't finished the task.
The hardest thing wass to position the images/backgrounds responsively so that that they change their position according to the designs of various device screens.
