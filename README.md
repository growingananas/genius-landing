# Genius Company Landing Page Implementation

## Overview
I have implemented the landing page for Genius company utilizing a combination of [**HTML**], [**SCSS**], **JS**, and [**Git**]. I managed to achieve the following goals:

•  [**Pixel-perfect**] design implementation

•  [**Fully-responsive**] layout

•  [**Functional burger menu**] for mobile and tablet views

## Challenges
The design was extensive, and due to time constraints, since I am working part time, I haven't fully completed the task. The most challenging aspect was to:

•  Position images and backgrounds responsively, ensuring they adapt correctly across various device screen designs.


## Notes
Further work is required to finalize the project and ensure all design elements are responsive and positioned according to the specifications for different devices.
